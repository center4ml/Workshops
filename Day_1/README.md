# Day 1: *Introduction to Machine Learning and PyTorch*

Jupyter Notebook dedicated for Machine Learning workshop for Center4ML in University of Warsaw.

**I've rewritten portions of this material in autumn of 2023 for the Statistics Seminar in MIM UW.**

## Agenda

The workshop notebooks cover the following topics:

- Introduction to tensors in PyTorch
- Automatic gradient functionality - computational graph
- Introduction to loss functions
- Classification neural network example
- Regression neural network example

## Requirements

Execute the following lines in a Jupyter terminal or before you launch Jupyter

```{bash}
pip install torch
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install torchvision
```

## Colab

Alternatively, run the notebooks in Colab with the provided `Open in Colab` badge at the top of each notebook.
