# Day 1: *Introduction to Machine Learning and PyTorch*

Jupyter Notebook dedicated for Machine Learning workshop for Center4ML in University of Warsaw.

## Agenda

The workshop notebooks cover the following topics:

- [Introduction to tensors in PyTorch](https://github.com/center4ml/Workshops/blob/2023_2_solutions/Day_1/0_tensors.ipynb)
- [Automatic gradient functionality - computational graph](https://github.com/center4ml/Workshops/blob/2023_2_solutions/Day_1/1_computational_graph.ipynb)
- [Introduction to loss functions - **not covered today**](https://github.com/center4ml/Workshops/blob/2023_2_solutions/Day_1/2_loss_functions.ipynb)
- [Classification neural network example - **not covered today**](https://github.com/center4ml/Workshops/blob/2023_2_solutions/Day_1/3_simple_MLP_Classification_MNIST.ipynb)
- [Regression neural network example](https://github.com/center4ml/Workshops/blob/2023_2_solutions/Day_1/3_simple_MLP_Regression.ipynb)

## Requirements

Execute the following lines in a Jupyter terminal or before you launch Jupyter

```{bash}
pip install torch
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install torchvision
```

## Colab
