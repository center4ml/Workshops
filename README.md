## Students version making

The students version is generated by executing script
[scripts/makeStudentsVersion.py][scripts/makeStudentsVersion.py].


Cells fragments enclosed between tags `#BEGIN_SOLUTION` oraz `#END_SOLUTION`
will be substituted with three dots: `...`

``` python
def classifier (X, threshold):
    #BEGIN_SOLUTION
    return X > threshold
    #END_SOLUTION
```

The above in student's version will become:
``` python
def classifier (X, threshold):
    ...
```

### Intruction:
```
cd Workshops/Day1
cp  0_introduction_to_tools.ipynb ~/
git checkout 2022_2
mv ~/ 0_introduction_to_tools.ipynb ./
./scripts/makeStudentsVersion.py 0_introduction_to_tools.ipynb
git commit -a
git push
git checkout 2022_2_solutions
```

**Notice**: The ```#END_SOLUTION``` can not be a in the last cell line. In such a case please put `pass` after the closing tag:

``` python
def classifier (X, threshold):
    #BEGIN_SOLUTION
    return X > threshold
    #END_SOLUTION
p	
```
